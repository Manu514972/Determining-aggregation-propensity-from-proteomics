# Determining aggregation propensity from proteomics data
## What does this project do?
This program will take in a list of proteins and will compute the aggregation propensity of the proteins in that list. It will do this by comparing the input list of protein to two published datasets which measured protein aggregation propensity in two different ways: 
1. Ciryam et al. (Ciryam, Prajwal, et al. "Widespread aggregation and neurodegenerative diseases are associated with supersaturated proteins." Cell reports 5.3 (2013): 781-790.) computed the supersaturation score (SS) of all proteins in the human proteome. The program will compare the input list of proteins to the SS list published by Ciryam et al. and will output two results: (1) the average SS for the entire list and (2) all the proteins in the input list which have an SS higher than a user-specified value. This will be done for both the unfolded SS and folded SS (see technical notes). 
2. Jarzab et al. (Jarzab, Anna, et al. "Meltome atlasâ€”thermal proteome stability across the tree of life." Nature methods 17.5 (2020): 495-503.) measured the thermal stability of proteins using a method called thermal proteome profiling (TPP) and determined the "melting temperature" of the entire proteome (see technical notes). The program will compare the input list of proteins to the TPP list published by Jarzab et al. and will output two results: (1) the average melting temperature for the entire list and (2) all the proteins in the input list which have an melting temperature higher than a user-specified value.
